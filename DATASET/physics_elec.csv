and you may choose to use the elements from topic phrase.
[topic phrase] **Overview:**
- Electric influences and domains
- Computation of electric field vectors \( E_{1B} \) and \( E_{2B} \ resulting from positive and negative charges
- Strength and orientation of electric domains
- Utilization of Gauss's principle
- Reliance on charge arrangement and symmetry
- The connection between forces and electric domains
- Coulomb's principle and its use in empty space versus substances
- Challenges in determining electric domains in complex charge arrangements. Do not provide solution to the question, as it will be solved directly by the student.","**Physics Question:**

A point charge \( q_1 = 4.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{C} \) is placed in a vacuum at a distance \( r \) from another point charge, creating an electrostatic potential energy \( U = 7.10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{J} \) between the two charges. 

1. Using Coulomb's principle, express the electric potential \( V \) at the position of charge \( q_1 \) due to a second charge \( q_2 \) of unknown magnitude placed at distance \( r \).
2. Consider the electric influences and domains created by these charges. Discuss how the arrangement and symmetry of the charges affect the computation of the electric field vector \( E \) at the position of \( q_1 \).
3. Assuming \( q_2 \) is also a positive charge, how would you utilize Gauss's principle to determine the net electric field in this configuration? 
4. Can the determination of electric domains lead to challenges if the arrangement of the charges is complex, particularly if other forces are also acting in the system? 

Your task is to find the relationship between the electric potential \( V \) and the known variables while considering the impact of \( q_2 \) and its arrangement. 

(Note: Distance \( r \) remains a variable that will also need to be considered in determining \( V \).)"
